> This project was developed for the technical challenge of the front-end developer job selection process at CodeLeap company

The main objective of the project was to create a responsive and user-friendly interface that could interact with an external API to retrieve and display data.

CodeLeap Network is a web application that allows users to write posts about any topic and view posts from other participants. It enables users to share their thoughts, ideas and experiences in a community. The app also includes features like deleting and editing your own posts.

Overall, CodeLeap Network is a social platform designed to promote communication, sharing and collaboration among its users.

The project was a great opportunity to demonstrate my skills as a front-end developer and showcase my ability to work with modern web development tools and technologies, including React, TypeScript, Redux, etc.
